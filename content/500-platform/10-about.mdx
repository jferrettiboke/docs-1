## Overview

Platform Console enables you to integrate the latest Prisma Data Platform (PDP) products into your application

- [Accelerate](/accelerate/what-is-accelerate): Global database cache with scalable connection pooling
- [Pulse](/pulse/what-is-pulse): A managed Change Data Capture (CDC) service that enables real-time database subscriptions

Open the [Platform Console](https://console.prisma.io).

## Workflows

The Platform Console workflows are based on three main concets:

- **Account**: In order to use PDP products, you need to have a PDP account. An _organization_ will typically create one account to manage all their workspaces, projects and environments.
- [**Workspaces**](/platform/about/workspace): An account can have multiple workspaces. A workspace typically represents a _team_ within an _organization_. Billing happens on a per-workspace basis, i.e. an _organization_ receives an invoice at the end of the month that captures all cost associated with the projects in a given workspace.
- [**Project**](/platform/about/project): A workspace can have multiple projects. A project typically represents the _application_ of a _product_ or _service_ a team is working on.
- [**Environments**](/platform/about/environment): A project can have multiple environments. An environment typically maps to a _development stage_, like `dev`, `staging` or `prod`.

Here is a visual illustration of how these concepts relate to each other:
